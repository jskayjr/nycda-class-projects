				<h2>This is a site about James going to coding school at NYCDA. On the site you will find links to homework projects, and some of my favorite books. </h2>

				<h2>I'm in coding school because I work with guys who code all day, all the time. I want to better relate to them; to walk the walk not just talk the talk. Despite the pragmatic origin, a love of html and css is quickly blooming.</h2>

				<h2>Only time will tell if it's  a fling, or the real thing.</h2>
